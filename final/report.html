            <p>Professor Mead reviewed my code and suggested that I was complicating a simple function. I had a problem with my previous java code where I couldn't get the image of the previous scene to revert when switching scenes with the previous and next buttons. To accomplish this, I made a clear button for each scene. So my Java Script for each button for each scene is shown below:
            </p><br>

            <img src="images/code1.png" alt="code1" height="" width="570">       
            
            <p>
                After reconsidering and organizing my thoughts after exploring the idea, I tried setting up all the images as one item first, and having the current image show up as my default image (which is the same one I was trying to get the individual chat images to revert to with the previous and next buttons earlier):
            </p><br>

            <img src="images/code2.png" alt="code2" height="" width="570">

            <p>This way, I just need to add in the previous and next buttons' functions to restore the image to the current image, and then change the src of this image to the image I need in each send buttonï¼š</p>

            <img src="images/code3.png" alt="code3" height="" width="570">
            <img src="images/code4.png" alt="code4" height="" width="570">
