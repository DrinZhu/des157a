            <p>I want to update Every Picture project Because I think the topic I chose is interesting and I have a lot of room to improve my project.

                I found that if I use the current interface design I guess I won't be able to change the size of the interface, resulting in me not being able to do a responsible version. So I'm going to overhaul the entire page design to no longer have the left side of the panel set in stone. The forward and backward buttons really need to be replaced with some icons to become neater, like arrows or something. I'm going to try to add avatars for contacting people to make this more interesting. I don't think I'll be able to fix the meme disappearing with the next scene change anytime soon. My major focus should be UI/UX design.

            </p><br>
            <p>
                I might test the usability with the class undergrad design tutor and the audience who like to use meme in the chat.
