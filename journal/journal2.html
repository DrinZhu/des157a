                The biggest advantage of a modal window is that it attracts the user's attention. The user can stop the original goal and complete the task in the modal window to accomplish the goal of the website. This is especially effective when the user is required to fill in advance information. However, this is also the biggest disadvantage of modal windows, as it is equivalent to interrupting the user's previous coherent experience, which can be doubly bad if there is a lack of thought in the design of the window.

                Careful consideration should be given to when, how, and why modal is used, and other user interface components such as non-modal and Descriptive Title should be explored.It is worth noting that buttons and keyboards play an almost decisive role in the modal window experience. Designers should never add too many unique elements to the usual task buttons; for example, the close button should generally be in the upper-right corner of the window.

                I never considered the design thinking and user experience of Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows until I read this article. Now that I think about it, a great modal window design can make a website twice as effective as it should be, and the opposite can even be a negative experience for the user. For example, the windows on some pages are too big, probably because they were not adapted during the transition between computer mode and mobile mode, resulting in the windows taking up almost 80% of the original page area. This not only makes the user feel that the window is very "rude", usually the close button in this case is also long outside the screen display or display incomplete, most people will be annoyed because they can not easily close a pop-up window.
