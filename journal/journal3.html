            <p>The article presents a compelling approach to enhancing reading and visual thinking skills through the analysis of photographs. For students, especially younger ones, when they engage in detective-like behavior by having them look at pictures, they improve their powers of observation and attention, and even have stronger critical thinking. Regularly practicing intriguing images not only allows students to develop meticulous skills, but also satisfies their curiosity. They even get to know some of the stories behind politics, history, and economics through interesting pictures, topics that are generally boring and not easily accessible.

                <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/"><strong>Awwwards.com</strong></a> is a website which features interesting and novel sites each day.

                I found a lot of very interesting visual ideas and designs on the <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/sites/les-arbres-fruitiers"><strong>LES ARBRES FRUITIERS</strong></a> website. The theme style of the site and the logo are in graffiti style. the logo is a reddish-orange logo in the shape of a four-leaf clover. The colors of the whole site are also very uniform so that one can tell at a glance that this is a system. The designer explores and flips through the pages by interacting with the four-leaf clover, which I find particularly appealing.
