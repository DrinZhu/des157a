            <p> I have learnt a lot and developed some insights about this article:
                I realised that finger reach placement in game interfaces is a serious but easily overlooked issue. Personally, I'm a right-handed person, and it bothers me when I'm using a mobile phone and there are tasks that need to be on the top left of the screen, especially if I can only operate the phone with one hand. But sometimes the capitalists take advantage of this to create a bad experience, for example, they put adverts in places that are the easiest for your fingers to reach and the easiest for you to accidentally touch. I'm sure no one would like to be in the middle of a gaming experience or just about to experience a game when they start to get into the marketing of adverts. I think finger reach and button placement also matter a lot. For example, in general, the continue button and the confirm purchase button are usually placed on the side of the person's dominant hand (usually the right side).

                Regarding the evaluation page aspect, I do suffer from this as well. For example, I've been sent a questionnaire to evaluate a game before I've even finished a relatively complete episode or playthrough of the game. This makes me feel that not only is my experience interrupted, but I don't have much of an idea of what to expect.

                For the game's mall and packs, I've had the experience of trying to buy a particular pack but accidentally turning off the pop-up window for the pack, and I haven't been able to find a way to open that pop-up window since. I was thinking that the gift packs were still disposable, but now I think it was a design error</a>.
